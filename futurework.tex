\section{Future Work}\label{sec-future}

	It is essential to update our tool to identify newer methods whenever a new API is released. It is also important to verify if the introduced API contains any sort of update that can lead to runtime errors due to incompatibility issues, such as the permission system introduced by API level 23. We also plan to include new detectors to identify mismatches other than API callbacks and permissions. Another idea is to warn users to replace methods for more secure ones, for example, using the new SSL API instead of the standard one, which still works but it is less secure than the newer method.\\
