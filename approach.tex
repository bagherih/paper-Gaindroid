%As previously mentioned, one major
%short-coming of the state-of-the-art approaches in
%detecting API compatibility issues is their inability
%to analyze application-under-analysis and the
%underlying ADF code in unison. As shown in
%Figure~\ref{fig:compare}a, these approaches perform
%analysis in two steps: analyzing the app and modeling
%the ADFs.  They then perform another layer of analysis
%that consider both results to detect API compatibility
%issues. In doing so, these approaches can miss
%detecting issues that lie deeper into the ADFs.

%\commentws{ \@approach can analyze the application and ADF code in unison by utilizing a novel class-loader-based program analysis approach. A class-loader is a runtime component that is part of any Java or Android Virtual Machine. It is responsible for incrementally loading any class needed during execution. It can accomplish this because of Java partition code into classes that can be individually loaded. \textit{\@approach adapts this runtime concept to support its scalable static analysis.} 


%In a nutshell, \@approach utilizes a \emph{ClassLoader Virtual Machine} (\emph{CLVM}) to perform class-based reachability analysis~\cite{tsutano2017efficient}. \emph{CLVM} takes advantage of code structure in Java to locate and load classes that can be reachable within a program.  As an example, if an application method calls an Android API, the class to which the API belongs would be loaded.  By utilizing CLVM, \@approach, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:compare}b, analyzes the application classes and only the reachable ADF classes, and not the entire ADF code. This analysis approach blurs the line that separates application and ADF code and significantly reduces both peak memory footprint and memory consumption over time (as will be shown later). Currently, \@approach can only analyze Dex code; it does not support the loading and analysis of native code.  

This section overviews our approach to automatically detect all three types of API- and permission-induced mismatches. 
As depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:arch}, \@approach takes as input an app APK\footnote{APK is package containing byte code and other resources used to distribute and install an Android application.} along with a set of Android framework versions, and produces a list of mismatches for the given Android app.  
\@approach comprises two main components:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\arabic*)]
    \item The \textit{API usage modeler (AUM)} that utilizes different static analysis techniques, i.e., control flow and data flow analyses, to  identify the API call sites and the concomitant conditions thereof; and
    %\item The \textit{Android revision modeler (ARM)} that extracts essential information about the framework APIs' lifetime and mappings between Android API calls and the permissions required to perform those calls from the Android framework revision history;
    \item The \textit{Android mismatch detector (AMD)} leverages the artifacts produced by AUM to effectively detect API- and permission-related mismatches in the app under analysis.
\end{enumerate*}
%Next, we describe the details of each component in turn.

\subsection{AUM: API Usage Modeler}
\label{API Usage Extraction}

The AUM module performs path sensitive, inter-procedural
data flow analysis on call and data flow graphs of a given
decompiled APK file to determine references to API methods
or callbacks.  More precisely, AUM derives an
inter-procedural control-flow graph, augmented to account
for implicit invocations (e.g., callbacks). The produced inter-procedural
control-flow graph is further annotated with permissions
required to enact Android API calls. Finally, a reachability
analysis is conducted over the augmented graph to identify
the guards that encompass the execution paths reaching the
annotated API calls or permission-required functionalities. 

\@approach's compatibility analysis has three major
advantages over the state-of-the-art approaches.
(1) To render our analysis more \emph{effective,
efficient, and scalable}, \@approach's AUM module
employs a novel class-loader based approach that incrementally discovers
pertinent application and ADF classes via reachability
analysis~\cite{tsutano2017efficient}.  
%It then analyzes only these classes. 
More specifically, \@approach's AUM module utilizes a \emph{Class Loader
Virtual Machine} (\emph{CLVM}) to perform class-based
reachability analysis~\cite{tsutano2017efficient}.
\emph{CLVM} takes advantage of the code structure in Java
to locate and load classes that can be reachable within
a program.  As a concrete example, if an application method
calls an Android API, the class to which the API
belongs would be loaded.  By utilizing CLVM, \@approach analyzes the application classes along with \emph{reachable} ADF classes, rather than analyzing the entire ADF codebase. 
%This analysis approach blurs the line that separates application and ADF code and significantly reduces both peak memory footprint and memory consumption over time.
This reduces both peak memory footprint and memory consumption over time, allowing \@approach
to be significantly faster and more space efficient
than the state-of-the-art in compatibility analysis.
The benefit comes without sacrificing the capability to detect
compatibility issues, as evidenced by the experimental
results (cf.  Section~\ref{sec-eval}).  
Some existing
state-of-the-art
techniques~\cite{huang2018understanding,he2018understanding},
on the other hand, directly load the entire code base
into memory, and thereby face scalability issues. 
%---\@approach's AUM module incrementally loads and analyzes
%classes 
(2) The AUM module analyzes actual ADF code to detect
\emph{more instances and types of compatibility issues}.
Prior work, on the other hand, focuses on creating models of
the ADF to only identify API callback compatibility
issues~\cite{huang2018understanding}.  
(3) While prior
work tends to analyze only the first call to the framework from an
app on each control flow path~\cite{lili2018cid}, the AUM module analyzes \emph{all} API calls and callbacks, which empowers
\@approach to detect \emph{more instances and types of
incompatibility issues}. 

\begin{comment}
Another key feature in Android that can affect the accuracy
of the compatibility analysis is late binding.  Indeed, apps
may dynamically load code that is not included in the main
dex file\footnote{A dex file incorporates compiled code which can be executed by an Android runtime.} of the
original application package, initially loaded at the
installation time.  This mechanism enables an app to be
extended with new desirable features at run-time. However,
in spite of its virtue, it poses challenges to analysis
techniques for assessing compatibility of Android apps.

To avoid missing any potential compatibility-related
issues that may result in crashes at run-time,
\@approach takes a conservative approach and considers
all possible bindings that can be statically
discovered.  More precisely, 
\end{comment}

Additionally, \@approach's AUM component
examines not only the main app code loaded at the
installation time, but also any other code accessible
from the app package that could be \emph{late bound}, or dynamically loaded, at run-time.
AUM incrementally augments the control-flow and
data-flow graphs by recursively identifying and
examining any classes which could be dynamically loaded by an app to
ensure that every method in every such class is
analyzed.\footnote{As one caveat, \@approach, as with any static analysis tool, cannot analyze classes dynamically loaded from remote servers.}
%Note that such to-be dynamically loaded code
%may not always be statically analyzable, especially
%when it is not bundled within installed packages, and
%rather externally loaded from remote servers.

\subsection{ARM: Android Revision Modeler} 

The ARM module derives both the API lifecycle and the permission mapping models through mining of the Android framework revision history.
It first constructs an API database containing all public APIs defined in Android API levels 2 through 28\footnote{The Android frameworks range from API level 2 through API level 28, collected using {\it sdkmanager}, shipped with the Android SDK Tools to manage packages for the Android SDK~\cite{sdkmanager}. }, allowing \@approach to determine which methods and callbacks exist in each level within the app's supported range. \@approach automatically mines Android framework versions and stores the captured API information in a format that can be effectively queried by both the AMD module to generate the list of APIs in each level and a method call graph for each API method.
Note that the API database is constructed once for a given framework, i.e., an Android API level, as a reusable model upon which the compatibility analysis of all apps relies.
The Android revision modeling component to derive the lifetime of each framework's API is realized in an entirely automated fashion, which in turn facilitates supporting the upcoming versions of the framework. %\tym{Note that ARM differs from the API Lifecyle Modeling (ALM) component of CiD in the following ways: } \commentty{We should explicitly list the differences if there are any.}



 \@approach next extends the database with mappings between Android API methods and the permissions required by the Android framework during the execution of those methods. To achieve this, ARM relies in part on PScout~\cite{au2012pscout}, one of the most comprehensive permission maps available for the Android framework,%. The issue in using PScout was that its latest mapping was provided for the Android API level 22. ARM, therefore, 
 extended to include new mappings that would reflect more up to date Android API levels. Similar to the Android API database, permission maps are constructed once and reused in the subsequent analyses.

\subsection{AMD: Android Mismatch Detector} 
\label{mismatchdetection}

The AMD module analyzes the artifacts
produced by the AUM to identify
API-related invocation and callback mismatches ({\it API Mismatch Detector}) and permissions-related
mismatches ({\it Permissions Mismatch
Detector}).
%\subsubsection{API Mismatch Detector}\label{subsec-permission-identification}
%The \textit{Mismatch Detection} component first checks for API compatibility issues (cf.
%Section~\ref{API Compatibility Issues}), using the following process to spot both
%API invocation and callback mismatches:
 


\begin{figure}[t]
%    \begin{minipage}{8cm}
%        %\vspace{-1cm}
        \input{algorithms/apc-algorithm}
        %\vspace{-3ex}
%    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}




\textit{Invocation mismatch:} The detector uses
the algorithm in Fig.~\ref{alg:api-mismatch} to detect API invocation
mismatches in each block of each method from the data flow
graph generated by static analysis of the app. If the
current block represents a guard condition (line 2), the
range of supported API levels is filtered by extracting the
minimum and maximum range from the guard and
updating the supported levels (line 3).
If the current block is a call to an API method (line 4),
check each supported API level to determine
whether the method called in the current block is defined in that level
(line 5-6).  In case that it is not defined, add the current
block to the set of mismatches (line 7).
%
In the case that an Android API is invoked inside a method
call, our algorithm (line 8) also checks if there is an
invocation to a user's defined method (i.e., not an
invocation to an Android API).  If this is the case, our
algorithm also analyzes the callee method  to look
for Android API invocations (line 9).
%This analysis process operates
%as a \emph{depth-first-search work-list} so it continues to
%follow any method invocation it encounters until reaching a
%terminal (i.e., a method that has no user defined method
%calls).
Finally, we reset the minimum and maximum supported
API levels to those defined in the app's manifest at the end
of each guard condition (lines 10-11).
%
%
%\commentws{Bruno, are you doing DFS with the algorithm? For
%example, if M1 is calling M2, then you would analyze M2 for
%API call. Let's say that in M2, there is a call to an
%Android API and then a call to M3, would you then go on and
%analyze M3? And if M3 calls M4, would your algorithm
%continues to analyze M4? Since you appears to be going
%deeper as more calls are encountered, I simply describe your
%algorithm as a DFS worklist. However, you will need to
%verify whether this is true.}
%
\@approach can reliably detect invocation mismatches because
the AUM component performs path-sensitive,
context-aware, and inter-procedural data-flow analysis,
which accounts for guard conditions on the
supported versions across methods, unlike other
state-of-the-art techniques, such as {\sc Lint} and {\sc
CiD}.

%        %\vspace{-1cm}
%    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\textit{Callback mismatch:} %For each method in the call graph, the detector executes Algorithm~\ref{alg:apc-mismatch}. 
The detector uses the algorithm in Fig.~\ref{alg:apc-mismatch} to detect API callback mismatches in each method within the call graph derived from the app under analysis.
If the method overrides an API callback
(line 2), iterate over the API levels that the app declares to support and check whether the callback is defined within the entire range
of supported API levels (lines 4-5). This sets our approach apart from prior
research, such as {\sc Cider}~\cite{wu2017measuring}, through
\emph{automatically} detecting incompatible API callbacks without requiring any
manual effort of compiling a list of candidate callbacks beforehand, thereby
making it widely applicable and practical.





The second internal component of the AMD detects
incompatibilities surrounding the new runtime permissions system introduced in
API level 23, a capability unique to \@approach. %(outlined in Algorithm~\ref{alg:permissions-mismatch}).
The logic of the algorithm in Fig.~\ref{alg:prm-mismatch} that checks permission-induced compatibility issues is as follows:
First, extract dangerous permissions from the app's manifest (line 2).  
%If there are no
%dangerous permissions there is no risk of permission mismatches,
%as normal permissions are automatically granted (lines 3-4).  
In case the app
requests dangerous permissions, retrieve the call graph from the AUM component (line 5), and check whether each method of the app that
targets API level 23 or newer overrides {\sf onRequestPermissionsResult} (lines
6-8). In case the app does implement the new runtime permission system, there
is again no risk of mismatch (line 9).  If the app either does \emph{not} implement
the new runtime system \emph{or} targets an API level earlier than
23, each usage of a dangerous permissions could result in a mismatch and crash.
To detect dangerous permission usages, iterate through each method in the call
graph (line 11), retrieve the data flow graph for the method (line 12) and check
whether each block in the data flow graph uses any of the dangerous permissions
(lines 13-15). In case any dangerous permission is used, add it to the
set~of~mismatches~(line~16).
